I’m a 3rd year Computer Science student who enjoys building backend and AI driven systems that are fast, reliable, and close to real world use. I like working on problems where performance, data quality, and system design matter.

I have worked across research, startups, and production environments, and I actively build projects end to end to strengthen my fundamentals.
